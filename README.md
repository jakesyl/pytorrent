# pytorrent
NOTE: This Repository is open source for Travis CI purposes.  The code is NOT STABLE, pytorrent is not finished.  You can checkout the code, and try to run it, but THERE WILL be errors.  After this project is done, this repository will be deleted, and a new one will be created without this commit history.  

Thanks!
Jake
